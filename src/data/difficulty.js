// Difficulty tiers (SPEC.md "Difficulty"). Difficulty picks the default strategy,
// how tightly its script is timed and (Phase 3) how much production it runs; it
// never makes the AI smarter or gives it resources. Phase 3 balanced the three
// strategies against each other, so a tier's strength now comes from execution:
// the Foundry cap is the handicap that measurably orders the tiers (test/fairness).
// Defaults were re-picked from the Phase 3 policy x tier x strategy measurement.
