# Spec: Phase 1 (sandbox) + Phase 2 (scripted AI opponent)

This file has the exact numbers for Phase 1 and, in the second half, Phase 2. The code reads them from
`src/data/units.js`, `src/data/buildings.js` and `src/data/map.js`. If you
change a number here, change it there too; `test/data.test.js` checks that
the key values match.

Conventions: 1 tile = 32 px. Speeds are in px/s. Times are in seconds.
*Range* is the **edge-to-edge gap** between the two footprints (unit
circles and building rectangles). The simulation runs at a fixed
`SIM_DT = 0.05 s` (20 Hz). The renderer interpolates between steps.

## Resources

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Resource | **Lumen** (one type) |
| Starting stockpile | **250** |
| Crystal node | 2×2 tiles, **1500** Lumen each, blocks movement, disappears when empty |
| Drone carry | **8** Lumen per trip |
| Mining time | **2.0 s** at the node (the Drone must be within 8 px of the node edge) |
| Drop-off | instant when within 8 px of a **completed Lumen Depot** (the Command Core is *not* a drop-off) |
| Loop | node → nearest depot → same node. If that node is empty, the Drone moves to the nearest node within 12 tiles, or goes idle if there is none. |

Expected income per Drone ≈ `8 / (2.0 + roundTripPx / 72)` Lumen/s.
`test/economy.test.js` checks this within ±15%.

## Units

| id | Name | Role | HP | Armor | Attack | Damage | Cooldown | Range | Speed | Radius | Cost | Train time | Trained at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| drone | Drone | worker | 40 | light | blade | 4 | 1.0 | 8 | 72 | 9 | 50 | 10 | Command Core |
| striker | Striker | light melee | 100 | light | blade | 10 | 0.6 | 8 | 85 | 11 | 60 | 12 | Foundry |
| sparker | Sparker | ranged | 65 | light | bolt | 15 | 0.75 | 176 | 70 | 10 | 70 | 14 | Foundry |
| bulwark | Bulwark | heavy | 300 | heavy | crush | 14 | 1.0 | 8 | 50 | 15 | 150 | 22 | Foundry |
| lancer | Lancer | anti-heavy specialist | 120 | light | lance | 26 | 1.4 | 128 | 60 | 11 | 110 | 18 | Foundry |

- Each hit deals `damage × multiplier(attack, armor) × U(0.9, 1.1)`. The
  random factor comes from the seeded RNG.
- Combat units auto-acquire enemies within **200 px** gap when idle or
  attack-moving. Drones never auto-acquire, but they attack when ordered.
- A chase ends when the target dies or the gap grows past **320 px**.
- Test targets and test units (verification only) belong to team 2.

### Damage multipliers

| Attack ↓ / Armor → | light | heavy | structure |
|---|---|---|---|
| blade | 1.00 | 0.40 | 0.50 |
| bolt | 1.00 | 0.40 | 0.50 |
| crush | 1.00 | 0.60 | 1.00 |
| lance | 0.35 | 2.50 | 1.50 |

### Counter table

`test/counters.test.js` checks each row with **N = 50** seeded fights. The
intended winner must win **at least 80%** of them.

| # | Matchup (A vs B) | Start gap | Intended winner | Nominal time to kill (A→B / B→A) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Striker vs Sparker | 4 px (melee) | Striker | 3.6 s / 4.5 s |
| 2 | Striker vs Sparker | 176 px (Sparker range) | Sparker | ≈2.0 + 3.6 s / 4.5 s |
| 3 | Bulwark vs Striker | 4 px and 176 px | Bulwark | 7.0 s / 44 s |
| 4 | Bulwark vs Sparker | 4 px and 176 px | Bulwark | 4.0 s (+3 s closing) / 36.8 s |
| 5 | Lancer vs Bulwark | 4 px and 128 px | Lancer | 5.6 s / 8.0 s |
| 6 | Striker vs Lancer | 4 px and 128 px | Striker | 6.6 s / 14 s |
| 7 | Sparker vs Lancer | 4 px and 176 px | Sparker | 5.25 s / 9.8 s |
| 8 | each combat unit vs Drone | 4 px | combat unit | — |

## Buildings

| id | Name | Footprint | HP | Armor | Cost | Build time | Function |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| core | Command Core | 4×4 | 1500 | structure | 400 | 60 | Trains Drones. The player starts with one. |
| depot | Lumen Depot | 3×3 | 600 | structure | 100 | 20 | Resource drop-off |
| foundry | Foundry | 3×3 | 800 | structure | 150 | 30 | Trains Striker, Sparker, Bulwark and Lancer |
| spire | Sentry Spire | 2×2 | 500 | structure | 120 | 25 | Defensive turret: bolt 14 dmg, 0.8 s cooldown, 224 px range |

- **Placement** follows the tile grid. A spot is valid only when every
  footprint tile is inside the map and free of rock, other buildings and
  crystal nodes. Units standing on a new footprint are pushed to the nearest
  free tile.
- **Construction:** the cost is paid when the site is placed. The ordering
  Drone walks to the site. Progress advances only while at least one Drone
  is building next to it (gap ≤ 8 px). Extra builders do not speed it up.
  HP grows from 10% to 100% of max as the site progresses. Cancelling an
  unfinished site refunds **75%**.
- **Production queue:** up to **5** items per building. The cost is paid
  when an item is queued, and items train one at a time in FIFO order.
  Cancelling any queued item, including the one in progress, refunds
  **100%**. A trained unit appears on the nearest free tile next to the
  building and walks to the rally point if one is set.
- No debt is allowed. Costs are paid up front (on placement or on queueing),
  and a command that costs more than the stockpile is rejected with an
  "insufficient Lumen" cue.

## Map (`src/data/map.js`)

- **80 × 60 tiles** (2560 × 1920 px), which is larger than one screen.
- Since Phase 2 the map is **mirror-symmetric about the vertical center line**
  so both starts are equally fair: a feature of width `w` at tile `x` has a twin
  at `80 − x − w`. The west half is unchanged from Phase 1.
- **Player start (team 1, west):** Command Core at tile (8,27). Four Drones at
  tiles (13,27)–(13,30). The camera starts centered on the Core.
- **AI start (team 2, east, match mode only):** Command Core at (68,27). Four
  Drones at (66,27)–(66,30).
- **Rock (impassable):**
  - Ridge A at x=30–31 and its mirror Ridge B at x=48–49, each covering
    y 0–17, 24–35 and 42–59. The gaps at y 18–23 and 36–41 are chokepoints.
  - Outcrops at (14,10) 4×3, (12,46) 5×3 and their mirrors (62,10) 4×3 and
    (63,46) 5×3. The center plateau is at (38,26) 4×8.
- **Crystal nodes (20 × 1500 Lumen):**
  - West home field: (20,21), (22,24), (23,27), (23,30), (22,33) and (20,36)
  - East home field (mirror): (58,21), (56,24), (55,27), (55,30), (56,33) and (58,36)
  - North-middle: (37,6), (41,6), (39,3) and (39,9)
  - South-middle: (37,51), (41,51), (39,48) and (39,54)

### Side symmetry (Phase 3)

The map is a mirror image, so every tie-break in the sim must be one too, or one
side gets a hidden edge. Before Phase 3, Economy-Boom mirrors went 26–33% west.
The rules now:

- **A\* and nearest-tile searches.** A unit in the east half plans in a mirrored
  frame: its start, goal and grid are flipped, the path is found with the
  west-half code, and the result is flipped back. Tie-breaks between equal-cost
  paths, the BFS "nearest reachable" order and the grid spiral order are
  therefore mirror images across the center line.
- **Spawn side.** A building without a rally point spawns units at its bottom
  corner nearest the map center: bottom-right in the west (as in Phase 1),
  bottom-left in the east.
- **AI build placement** searches outward from a spot in mirror-image order.
- `test/sidebias.test.js` asserts these rules. It also plays jitter-free mirror
  matches of each strategy and requires them to stay an exact mirror image for
  90 s.

## Movement & pathfinding

- **Library:** PathFinding.js 0.4.18 (`PF.AStarFinder`) routes on the 80×60 tile
  grid. Diagonals are allowed only when no corner is cut (`allowDiagonal` +
  `dontCrossCorners`; the CDN browser bundle uses these legacy option names).
  Headless tests load that exact CDN bundle.
- **Smoothing:** the A* tile path is string-pulled greedily. A shortcut is kept
  only if a band **±12 px** either side of the segment is walkable, so units
  don't hug rock corners. Intermediate waypoints count as reached within
  **12 px**; the final one within 2 px.
- **Blocked or unreachable goals** resolve to the nearest walkable tile, or to
  the nearest tile *reachable* from the unit (found by BFS flood fill).
- **Group moves keep the group's shape.** Each unit aims at `goal + (its
  offset from the group centroid)`. The offsets are compressed to about
  `0.75·√n` tiles if the group is spread out. Each target then snaps to the
  nearest free walkable tile, so every unit gets a distinct destination and
  paths rarely cross.
- **Separation (spatial hash, 2 passes per tick):**
  - Overlapping units push apart.
  - A moving unit shoves an idle one **sideways**, off its heading, rather than
    bulldozing it.
  - Movers meeting roughly head-on each sidestep **away from the side the
    other is on** (so a mirrored pair sidesteps in mirror image). Only an exact
    head-on tie falls back to both stepping right.
  - Moving-vs-moving collisions are **soft** (25% of the overlap is resolved per
    tick), so crowds flow through chokepoints. Idle units separate fully.
  - Drones on the gather loop pass through each other.
  - A settled unit drifts back to where it stopped if it gets jostled up to 96 px.
  - Positions never enter blocked tiles; units slide along walls.
- **Stuck recovery:**
  - Progress is measured as the shrinkage of the remaining path length, so a
    unit jostled back and forth doesn't count as moving.
  - Less than 4 px of progress in 1.0 s triggers a re-plan. Every 0.5 s a unit
    also re-plans if it has been pushed behind an obstacle relative to its next
    waypoint.
  - Re-plans while pressed against moving traffic don't count as failures, for
    up to 15 s of waiting. After 3 counted failures the unit stops, so it is
    never stuck forever.
- **Performance budget:** 40 units moving at once must average **< 5 ms per sim
  step** in CI (`test/stress.test.js`). They currently average about 0.2 ms.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Left-click | Select a unit or building (Shift = add or remove) |
| Left-drag | Box-select your own units (Shift = add) |
| Right-click enemy / test target | Attack it |
| Right-click crystal (with Drones) | Gather |
| Right-click Depot (with carrying Drones) | Return cargo |
| Right-click own unfinished building (with Drones) | Help construct |
| Right-click ground | Move in formation. With a Core or Foundry selected, this sets the rally point. |
| **A** then left-click | Attack-move (engage enemies met on the way) |
| **S** | Stop |
| **Ctrl + 1–9** (or **Shift + 1–9**) | Assign a control group. Desktop Chrome reserves Ctrl+1–8 for switching tabs, so Shift is the reliable choice there. |
| **1–9** | Select a control group (press twice to center the camera on it) |
| **Q W E R** (Drone selected) | Place a Command Core, Depot, Foundry or Sentry Spire. Left-click places it, and Esc or right-click cancels. |
| **Q** (Core selected) | Train a Drone |
| **Q W E R** (Foundry selected) | Train a Striker, Sparker, Bulwark or Lancer |
| Click a queue slot / **Backspace** | Cancel that item / the last queued item (full refund) |
| **X** (unfinished building selected) | Cancel construction (75% refund) |
| Arrow keys, screen-edge mouse, middle-drag | Pan the camera |
| **Home** | Center the camera on the Command Core |
| **M** | Mute or unmute |
| **\`** (backtick) | Toggle the dev panel. It spawns **test targets** and team-2 test units for verification. This is not a game feature. |

## Verification

1. **Pathfinding** (`test/pathfinding.test.js`, `test/stress.test.js`):
   units route around rocks and buildings, and no unit stays stuck. 40 units
   crossing the map finish within the time budget without lasting overlap.
2. **Economy** (`test/economy.test.js`, `test/production.test.js`): the
   gathering rate matches the formula, costs are deducted, queues run in
   FIFO order, and cancels refund correctly.
3. **Counters** (`test/counters.test.js`): N=50 fights per row of the counter table.
4. **Selection and control** (`test/selection.test.js`, `test/e2e`):
   box-select, control groups and attack-move.
5. **Bot sandbox** (`test/bot.test.js`): a scripted bot builds every
   building, trains one of each unit and wins a fight against test targets.

---

# Phase 2: Scripted AI opponent

Everything below is **match mode** (`World({ setup: 'match' })`). The Phase 1
sandbox (`setup: 'start'`, player only) still exists, and all Phase 1 tests run
in it.

## Population (supply)

This applies identically to every team; the rules are in the sim, not in the AI.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Supply per unit | Drone 1, Striker 1, Sparker 1, Lancer 2, Bulwark 3 |
| Supply provided | Command Core **10**, Lumen Depot **8** (completed buildings only) |
| Hard maximum | **60** per team, however many providers |
| Starting use | 4 / 10 |

- `used` = the supply of living units **plus queued production** (reserved when
  queued, released on cancel).
- `train` is rejected with "Not enough supply" when `used + unit supply > cap`.
- Losing a provider never kills units. It only blocks new training until
  supply is back under the cap.
- The HUD shows `Supply used / cap`.

## Win / lose

- A team is **defeated** the moment it has no *completed* Command Core. The
  other team **wins**.
- If both teams lose their last Core in the same tick, the result is a **draw**.
- **Sudden death:** at **30:00** of game time the match ends on score. Score =
  banked Lumen + the cost of every living unit and completed building (plus the
  cost already paid for unfinished ones). The higher score wins; equal scores draw.
- Together these rules guarantee every match ends with a declared result.
- When the result is set, `world.result = { winner, loser, reason, time }`
  (`winner` is `null` for a draw), a `gameOver` event fires, and the sim freezes:
  `step()` does nothing and `issue()` rejects every command. The browser shows
  a Victory, Defeat or Draw screen.

## Enemy scanning (combat target acquisition)

- Every tick the sim rebuilds a **spatial index**: a uniform grid of 128 px
  cells. Units go into the cell holding their center. Buildings go into every
  cell their footprint overlaps.
- `findEnemy(e, range)` only visits the cells within `range` plus the largest
  footprint. Each scan therefore costs about the number of entities *near* the
  unit, not the number in the whole world.
- Results are identical to the old brute-force scan: the nearest enemy unit,
  then buildings. A test checks this against brute force.
- Budget: a **200-unit** battle (100 vs 100) must average **< 8 ms per sim step** in CI.

## AI architecture

- `src/ai/engine.js` is the **AI execution engine**. It grew directly out of the
  Phase 1 scripted bot (`test/bot.js`, now `src/ai/engine.js`; the bot test still
  runs through it).
- The engine reads the world and acts **only through `world.issue(cmd)`**, with
  its own team stamped on every command. Its whitelist of commands has no
  `devSpawn`. A test runs full matches with the engine given a recursively
  read-only view of the world, and fails on any direct mutation.
- The engine runs outside the `World` (the match loop calls
  `world.step()` then `ai.update()`), so it is headless-testable and never
  touches Phaser or the DOM.
- **Data files:**
  - `src/data/strategies.js` has every strategy's opening, macro loop, army
    composition, attack thresholds and scouting triggers.
  - `src/data/difficulty.js` has each tier's timing parameters.
  - Phase 3 tunes these without touching engine code.

### Engine loop (every `decisionInterval` seconds)

1. **Bookkeeping:** track pending construction.
2. **Scout:** update what the AI knows and evaluate triggers (see below).
3. **Gather:** put idle Drones on the nearest crystal to their own base.
4. **Opening:** issue the next step of the strategy's `opening` list. A step
   waits until it's affordable and has supply. After a step succeeds, the
   engine waits the difficulty's `stepDelay` before the next.
5. **Macro loop** (after the opening), in this order:
   1. Build a Depot when `cap − used ≤ supplyBuffer` and none is under construction.
   2. Train Drones up to `workerTarget × workerFactor`, at most 1 queued at the Core.
   3. Build the strategy's extra `structures` once their conditions hold.
   4. Keep each Foundry's queue at 2 or fewer, picking units from the
      composition weights. Scouting overrides can shift the weights.
6. **Army control:**
   - Units gather at the rally point in front of the base.
   - When the army reaches `firstWave` (then `wave`), it **attack-moves to the
     enemy Command Core**. Near the Core with no enemy units within 200 px, it
     issues a direct `attack` on the Core.
   - If the army falls below `retreatBelow` of its wave size, it pulls back to
     the rally point. Rush never retreats.
   - While a wave is out, new units reinforce it if `reinforce` is set.

Building spots are offsets from the team's own Core, given for the west base
and mirrored for the east base. If a spot is taken, the engine searches nearby
tiles in a spiral and keeps a 1-tile margin free around each building, so it
never walls itself in.

### Strategies (`src/data/strategies.js`)

These are the tuned values from the playthroughs in slices 6–8. The data file
is authoritative, and `test/playthrough.test.js` exercises each strategy.

| | **Rush** | **Economy-Boom** | **Turtle-and-Tech** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opening | drone, depot, drone, foundry, striker, striker, drone | drone, drone, depot, drone, drone, depot, drone, drone, foundry, drone | drone, drone, depot, drone, foundry, spire, drone, spire |
| Worker target | 8 | 16 | 12 |
| Extra structures | Foundries up to 3 whenever Lumen ≥ 250 | 2nd Foundry once 12+ Drones; 3rd Depot once 14+ Drones; 3rd Foundry whenever Lumen ≥ 600 | Spires up to 4 (a new one per 2 army units); 2nd Foundry whenever Lumen ≥ 400 |
| Composition (weights) | Striker 3, Sparker 1 | Striker 2, Sparker 2, Bulwark 1, Lancer 1 | Bulwark 3, Lancer 2, Sparker 2 |
| First wave / later waves | 6 / 5 units | 14 / 10 units | army supply 36 / 30 (it builds up by supply) |
| Retreat below | never | 35% of the wave | 30% of the wave |
| Reinforce a wave | yes, in groups of 3 or more | no | no |
| Scout drone sent at | 30 s | 60 s | 90 s |

**Macro loop details:**
- A Depot goes up when `free ≤ supplyBuffer + number of producers`.
- Idle Drones spread over the four crystals nearest the base, least-busy first.
- Any unfinished site of the AI's with no builder (for example, because the
  builder died) is reassigned a Drone, so construction can never stall.

Every strategy also defends: enemy combat units within 16 tiles of its
buildings pull the army home, whatever the wave state.

### Scouting: what the AI can see

This is a *lightweight scan* of AI perception, not a fog-of-war game mechanic:
the player still sees the whole map, as PROJECT.md requires.

- Every **2 s** the AI records enemy units and buildings that are:
  - within **16 tiles (512 px)** of any of its own buildings (base watch), or
  - within **7 tiles (224 px)** of any of its own units, including one **scout
    Drone** that walks to the enemy start at the time in the strategy table and
    then returns to mining.
- It remembers each sighting (type, position, time) for **90 s**, including
  units that have since died: "the enemy fielded six Strikers" is still true.
- The scan uses plain loops over entities. It never queries the sim's spatial
  index, which writes bookkeeping onto entities.
- From that memory it derives: the enemy combat units seen by type, the enemy
  buildings known, and the enemy units currently near its base.

### Scouting-triggered reactions

| Trigger | Condition | Reaction |
|---|---|---|
| **Early aggression** | Before **5:00**, at least **2** enemy combat units inside base watch | Enter **defend** mode: recall any wave, attack-move the army to the threat, bias production 70% toward counters of the attacking types, and build Spires up to 1 (Turtle: 2) as an *urgent* build, alongside any other construction. Defend mode ends after **20 s** with no enemy near the base. |
| **Massing** | An enemy combat type with at least **5** seen *and* a **majority (≥ 50%)** of the enemy army seen. A balanced army never trips it. | **Counter composition:** 70% of new production goes to that type's counter from the Phase 1 table. It lasts until the condition clears. |

A trigger takes effect only after its condition has **held for the
difficulty's reaction delay**. A raid wiped out faster than that isn't treated
as a rush.

The thresholds were first 4 seen and 40%. Playthroughs showed the scout Drone's
partial view of a balanced army tripping that repeatedly, and swinging
production away from the plan, so they were raised to the values above. All
thresholds live in `SCOUTING` in `src/data/strategies.js`.

Fixed player-side test scripts (`sentinel`) set `scouting: false`, so they
never adapt.

Counter picks (from the PROJECT.md counter table):
- Striker is countered by Bulwark (with Sparker).
- Sparker is countered by Bulwark (with Striker).
- Bulwark is countered by Lancer.
- Lancer is countered by Striker (with Sparker).

### Difficulty (`src/data/difficulty.js`)

Difficulty controls *which strategy runs* and *how well-timed the script is*.
It never makes the AI smarter, and it never cheats.

| | Easy | Normal | Hard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default strategy | Rush | Turtle-and-Tech | Economy-Boom |
| Decision interval | 2.5 s | 1.2 s | 0.5 s |
| Extra delay after each opening step | 6 s | 2 s | 0 s |
| Reaction delay before a trigger takes effect | 25 s | 10 s | 3 s |
| Worker factor (× worker target) | 0.7 | 0.9 | 1.0 |

| Timing jitter (± share, seeded) | 30% | 20% | 10% |

The default strategies follow their **measured** strength rather than a guess.
The first mapping (Easy = Boom, Hard = Rush) was inverted: fairness runs showed
Economy-Boom is the strongest script and Rush the weakest against a defending,
reacting player.

The start screen also lets the player pick the strategy explicitly (Auto uses
the default above), or play the Phase 1 **Sandbox** with no opponent.

### Fairness protocol (`test/fairness/`)

- Three **player-side policies** run on the same engine as the AI, as team 1:
  - **competent:** Economy-Boom with Hard timing and scouting reactions
  - **intermediate:** Turtle-and-Tech with Easy timing
  - **novice:** Rush with Easy timing
- Each plays **12 fixed seeds** (1–12) against each tier with its default
  strategy. The sim is deterministic, so CI reproduces the exact numbers.
- Required:
  - The competent policy wins **at least 75% on Easy, 50% on Normal and 10% on
    Hard** (beatable at every tier).
  - Every policy's win rate falls monotonically from Easy to Normal to Hard.
  - The novice wins **at most 50%** at every tier, and Hard beats the
    intermediate policy **at least 75%** of the time (not a pushover).

## Controls added in Phase 2

- **Control groups:** Chrome reserves Ctrl+1–8 for tab switching, so pages
  never receive those keys. Phase 2 fixes this in three ways:
  - **Shift+1–9** is the primary assign key. Ctrl+1–9 still works wherever the
    browser delivers it.
  - A **control-group bar** in the HUD shows each group's size. Click a slot to
    recall it, and Shift-click or right-click to assign the current selection.
  - A **Fullscreen** button requests the Keyboard Lock API, which lets Chrome
    deliver Ctrl+1–9 to the game while in fullscreen.
- **Under attack:** when enemy fire hits your units or buildings, a toast and a
  two-tone alarm fire (at most once per 15 s of game time), and **Space** jumps
  the camera to the last attack.
- The result screen offers **Play again** (same setup) and **Change difficulty**
  (back to the start screen).

## Phase 2 verification

1. **Regression:** every Phase 1 test still passes, and the sandbox bot test
   now runs through the AI engine.
2. **Playthroughs:** each strategy plays a full match against the fixed
   `sentinel` script in CI, through the read-only guard. It completes its
   opening, trains an army, launches waves that cross into the enemy half and
   engage, and the match ends with a declared result. Separately, each strategy
   marches on an undefended base and wins by destroying the Command Core.
3. **Scouting:** scripted scenarios trigger early aggression and massing for
   each unit type, and the tests assert the branch taken.
4. **Supply:** both teams are capped identically, and Depots raise the cap (to
   the hard max of 60).
5. **Win/lose:** destroying either Core ends the match with the right result;
   simultaneous loss is a draw; the time limit always ends the match.
6. **Fairness:** repeated bot-vs-AI runs per difficulty with a competent and a
   novice player-side policy. Win rates are reported in the test output and
   the README.
